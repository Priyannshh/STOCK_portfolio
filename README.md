This is a console-based Stock Portfolio Management System built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++.
 
It allows users to manage stock holdings, calculate projected profits, and view summarized portfolio details.

üß† OOP Concepts Demonstrated
‚Ä¢	Inheritance: Stock inherits from the base class Asset.
‚Ä¢	Polymorphism: show() is a virtual function, overridden in Stock.
‚Ä¢	Encapsulation: Data members are protected/private and accessed through methods.
‚Ä¢	Dynamic memory allocation: Assets are created using pointers and managed using new and delete.
